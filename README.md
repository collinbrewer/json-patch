# JSONPatch
On top of being a very fast implementation of an RFC 6902 patching utility, JSONPatch offers many additions including:

   - **Abridging**: Optimize and condense patches.
   - **Reversing**: Inverse patches to negate the action of a given patch.
   - **Mapping**: Translate a patch to that of a different mapping.
   - **Versioning**: Adds methods for dealing with versioning.
